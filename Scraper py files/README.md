# Compare My Shop
A web application that works out where your shopping is cheapest!

Currently in development, hoping to make it part of my portfolio in the future.

## Details on the web scraper
It's a simple price web scraper for Trolley.co.uk (the most complete collection of up to date UK shop prices I could find)

This simple python script takes a search item and retreives the prices and product page from Tolley.co.uk/explore/search-item-here, then creates a file that can be used by a DB (haven't decided on one yet) as a seed file.
