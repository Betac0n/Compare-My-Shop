# Compare-My-Shop
**A web app that compares supermarket prices to find where your shopping will be cheapest.**

This a simple python web application that uses data from [Trolley.co.uk](Trolley.co.uk) to provide insight into what shops are the cheapest for any given shopping basket. It is currently under construction and will be released as a Demo on [my portfolio site](https://betac0n.github.io) once it's complete. See the [about page](https://betac0n.github.io/project-pages/Compare-My-Shop/about) for details about the project.

## Features
- Single Shop Mode: Find the over all cheapest shop
- Multi Shop Mode: Find the best shops for the overall cheapest basket
- Basket functionallity: Add multiple items to a 'basket' that are all taken into account when calculating the cheapest shops
- Search functionallity: Search for any item that is listed in the database to add to your basket
- Friendly and simple UI
